My project idea is to program a reinforcement learning system that plays the game Minesweeper. For this I intend to implement a simple Q-learning system like in the stanford paper, and try to improve its results (bring your own method project type).
To gather data I will program a simple version of the game. 

So the first step of the project will be to program a minimal version of minesweeper, which should not take more than ~2 days.
The next step will be implementing the Q-learning system, which I expect to be the longest part of the project.
After that i will try to find ways to improve the implementation. The workload of this will be quite dependent on the results.
The final step would be to program a more user friendly version of the game to better show the results, the required time for this is heavily dependent on how long the previous steps take.
